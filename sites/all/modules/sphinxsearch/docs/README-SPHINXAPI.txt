The lib directory under the sphinxsearch module contains the file sphinxapi.php
which is part of Sphinx 0.9.8, released under GPL v2. I think this is compatible
with Drupal contrib modules. Please, ping me if you think otherwise.

sphinxapi.php script implements the Sphinx API for PHP that this module is based
and depends on.
