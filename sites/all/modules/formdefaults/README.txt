DESCRIPTION
------------

Form Defaults will let you alter the defaults associated with a form, enable the forms module below and look for the [edit] controls in the description of each form field. Navigate to the form and click [edit] link on the field you want to edit. You'll be allowed to edit field titles, markup fields as well as the textual descriptions with each field.
